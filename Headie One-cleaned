Chubbs might jam this yute for a chain
And give it to a sweet one, called that Maya Jama
Givin' out gifts like Santa, sippin' on Sanna
Used to do lean and Wock'
Closet filled up with designer, comin' like Panda, Panda
Yeah, gyal just came to the booth and asked for a wheel
She never heard drill in Atlanta
Arabic ting told me that I look like Youssef, look like Hamza
Habibti please, ana akeed, inti wa ana ahla
With Pop Skull in Gaza, but not that Gaza, but still it's a mazza
Niggas want peace like Cassava
But we let bridge dem burn like grabba
Woi
Four in the cliz and one in the headie
Hand no shake, man, hold that steady
You man love pose with the ting for the picture
You man shoulda buss that ting already
You man love hezi', hezi'
Yeah, can't backchat to the Prezi'
Know when the beef just taste like veggie?
Gyal go Ritz for the mani-pedi
CC bag look nice, but the Birkin bag look way more heavy
That's just a big gyal ting, man, you get me?
Raemi just turned mommy, and that's my sis, so I just turned abti
Fan mail came to the crib from a yute that loves me, I swear that touched me
I never even drive no whips I own, so they all look way too dusty
If me and Gallest go St. Michael, the gyal come way too fussy, crushy
Man said they would do this and that, but the man wasn't really that wassi, was he?
Nah, nah, nah, the man wasn't really that what?
One-nine-four-two hits my system, man get way too frosty, buzzy
Girls from the past that lost me love me
Same ones there that crossed me, cuss me
Everything come full circle, word to the boss above me
Slow stroking 'cause the bamski way too big, my gyal don't rush me
Woi
Don't make me have to rise my rifle
Man try send some young boys for me, don't make me have to ride by high school
Shit you man been droppin' lately, don't make me have to fly my iTunes
So much people buy into my hype, don't make me have to buy my hype too
Dealt with the big homie already, don't make me have to side-by-side you
Nuff times he tried to hide behind you
Amnesia but when I remind you
I'm touchin' road and I can't find you
Word to the M-O-B I'm tied to
I'm givin' up when I decide to, jheeze

They should know better
They should know better

Melo Beats
Traphouse Mob


Bad B on the Nizz
You really think I went upsie for scrum?
Live corn in the shh
I could’ve let it in the uni room 
But I know better
Opps wanna see me get nicked with a shh
But I know better
Next day shh got-got by shh 
Gang done got down two this week, that's shh and shh 
They should know better
Don’t see me in the flesh and don’t make man leak 
Man do shit for the 'gram and tweet
Man rise that shh and skeet 
How many: shh, shh, shh, shh? Let's see 


Man could’ve put it on the net
When gang done chinged up shh 
And the bros didn’t neither
Man just left it to the media 
They say I took a L in L 
But shh made a W in W 
Anything green get wah, then oh lord 
Know better 
Anything shh, shh, excellent finish, Mo Salah 
How man tell me buss my shh?
Only 'cah they know I’m on camera
They want me in the bin, Osama 
That would’ve been four summers 




Suh, suh, s-s-s-suh



Ain't it different?  I link my ting in LA
But I can't fly to the States 'cah I got too much convictions 
Apparently all I talk is prison, but I don't know no different 
'Cah I was in jail up north, runnin' another coalition 
Fresh home, I bought coke and whipped it
I put some roses where my wrist is
You ain't ever made a birthday cake from Digestive biscuits 
Will have to take lemon juice to a piss test 
Every day I look up to the Lord, give thanks for all this litness 
Come home, fresh out the system, gymnast
Rollin' with smoke on my jones
Pigs want all the camera on me, not the one from Dipset 
I still can't mix pleasure with business, sorry, princess 
I come a long way from broke days 
I got to work and fixed it

Baby, are you up for this?
I am feeling hot tonight
Ready for the bump and grind
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
Baby, are you up for this? 
I am feeling hot tonight 
Ready for the bump and grind
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah 


Ain't it different? 
Spent like ten years grindin' 
Covered in diamonds, never been minin'
Came through, man's still shinin' 
'Cah I was in Homeford House with the pack 
And now I'm in Dubai, limin' 
Me and Headz landed abroad, two new kettles, perfect timin' 
The new whip's white on white, peanut butter, rose gold linin' 
You can catch me in Central 
Car so dumb, when I press this button, it's gone, I don't do rentals 
Air 1's fresher than menthol 
I don't wanna get shit lit, but the way that bro grip sticks ain't gentle 
Summer time shootouts, big big loot-outs
Get corn stuck in your dental

Bad B come to the niz, skin all gold, she cute 
How's her boyfriend pissed 'cause she knows my tunes?
I need me a skeng, I can't fit it in the ride
We might have to slide with an open boot 
Scored all of these points this season 
OFB won the Golden Boot 

Still do it how I did it with Skat 
We've really wore those boots 
Opps see the offside flag 
And come like they forgot their boots
Them man there selective bad boys 
I really don't know how they pick and choose 
The whole gang spent bands on boots 
Them man can't afford no boots 


I'm married to Elizabeth, that's my wife 
Anyting green get bun, still do it like I done it like half my life 
Any sight of the goal, man shoot 
Perform this excellent finish, I do it like Kane or Lukaku 
Old school like Bergkamp and Henry
Ammunition stays on me
Keep an eye out for undies 
Sawn-off cost me a monkey 
Opposition wish they can touch me
I remember pedal bike days and the kitchen knife gettin' frontied  
Now man just fly out the front seat, opps know that the gang too dumpy 
Age seventeen in country, me and Jay like Lucas and Bumpy 
My first phone call's my alarm clock, the line too jumpy 
I tell my young boys, "Fly upsee" 
I hit shots from far like Roberto Carlos 
All I do is organise orders, come like I work in Argos 
I do it for the bread, no hard dough 
Headie One need a reload in Cargo
Still tryna do it like they did it in Narcos 
I put weight on my phone, no cardio 
Opps see me in the flesh and they can't help when their heart goes 
All we did is pressure these opps, now they can't stand in the field like Marlo 

Pipe it up PJ
Nastylgia


T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, there’s both
Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke
Man spend it on both
Counting up this money from O or money from shows
Man's counting up both
Paps need a pattern business and a pattern up home
Man patternin' both
Feds draw me out for a works and smoke
Tryna do me for both
They want me back on soch', using chips and rice
Tryna pattern me both
But I'm on road, yellow bones, brown ones, I get loving from both
Money and success, just let a young nigga go govern up both

Me and T Buck see two opps on the mains
And we ended up doing up both
Too much beef on the streets
We're hitting two blocks and we're shooting up both
I know feds want me back up in courts
Sat in front of the judge just doing up oath
How many times in jail was it bread and oats?
Put peanut butter on both
Now they say that I'm the king of drill
Trap, rap, I'm doing it all
Everywhere and everywhere, the gang's smokey
Let the gangdem bring it on tour
Every day I hear niggas tryna draw me out
Why they all want me to war?
.44 long and that poisonous scopes
They don't want us bringing out both


Come look at the table, it's a lawn chair
I had go get, traphouse really had no air
You was out clubbin' with nowhere
OT, I had to go there
But then I ain't done a show here
Remember I had plans to go near
In the fast lane, I don't know where

18 hunna for the new rusty
Four and a half in the bando, profit oh-so lovely
169


18 hunna for the new rusty
Man grab it and kick it like rugby
I was in the T house, head back dusty
Still waking up to nudes in country
Four and a half in the bando
Profit oh so lovely
My little bro shitted out the pack and flushed it
Tell me how he could be so clumsy?
These bad Bs coming to the niz
They don't really love me, but they love me
From qway, been doing up upsy
Yeah, I swear man done more sales than Gumtree
If I get me that drop, it won't be nuttin' like Humpty's
Backdoor bus, watch me get dumpy
These opps can't never get comfy

Heart of a lion
Skenged up for the field
Cah I might buck me a python
Snakes in the grass, I don't know who's preeing on my ting
Still gotta keep money on my mindset
Losing weight all last year
And I ain't ever been on no diet
Shh-shh got shh, all bait
All now gang gotta keep that one quiet
Half asleep last night, I done a night shift
I couldn't even count those tenners and fivers
I was fifteen stepping, stressing out cab drivers
Skengs in the wiz, no licence
I know full well where the 9 is
You can't talk about riding


18 hunna for the new rusty
Man grab it and kick it like rugby

Told me turn, ayy
Yo


The plaques come platinum, my bezel's stainless
Whip goes fast and the crib’s outrageous 
Just spent twenty-eight K on production
Light up a stage and leave in a spaceship 
Day-Date plain for the day
GG on my waist, CC on my trainers 
Pagans, they wanna play
If I pipe her down, after that, we're strangers 

Old school like Ratatouille
Now I just act a fool in Louis 
Brown skin girl, caramel coulis
Pockets fat, Andy Ruiz 
Pop that Ace of Spades
I drank from the bottle, now my outfit ruined 
Ah, I bought a new one, could be Newham


Fuck it, I'll bеat if the bitch is ratchet
Long as her hands and feet arе matchin’
Young Aitch don't dive in the pussy
I take off my DSQ's and backflip 
Air 1's come white like my ashes
But I won't smoke if it ain't rolled backwards
Long time, I ain't seen the mandem
It's just me, myself and the cameras 


First-class when I stamp this yay
I got it with wads, not Apple Pay 
Route to the clearport, personalised Air Force 
And they’re lookin’ all crack cocaine 
If I get bored, the destination's St. Tropez 
St. Tropez, me and shorty twinnin’ in Saint Laurent 


Turn, turn, turn



My young boy got the stick like Moses with the Israelites
Tellin' them opp boys, "It's on sight" 
They ain't outside , they stay inside 
We can't party if we can't get the tray inside 
Shoe cocaine white, teeth Colgate white 
You know what it gets like, I just gotta step right 
Trackie and my sliders, I got beef that I still don't let slide 
All those double C's, I got a Chanel side 
I'm really blowin' trees in the Middle East 
Is you from the Philippines or Vietnamese? 
I don't dance, but I can shake a leg 
I one-two step, Billie Jean, Billie Jean 

Got twenty on my wrist, I'm going crazy
Canary princess cuts for my baby
Out the window, I can hear the Old Bailey
Sippin' LOUIS XIII, I'm with a Casey
I made a wish, I got it, then I made a wish list
Bust case, was no witness
A hundred in a duffle bag, I got a big fish
Shorty, you need assistance 


I'm in Dior, I'm a Christian, praise the Lord 
More time, I'm on road if I ain't on tour 
I pack light, first-class flight, hit them stores 
Hand luggage, if I could, I would take this .4 
Ride with my jewels on an everyday thing 
My rose gold wrist, this an inspiration 
Feds tryna take away my liberation 
They don't like the way I handle situations 
Shorty need assistance , I'm far from an assistant 
She don't see the vision , I just love her from a distance 
She slim thick, she take it all, she thick thick 
Unreleased Off-White, she sayin', "Oh, Headie, you got drip drip"
I'm still out here in the field, it's a picnic 
I got my tracksuit covered in her lipstick 
Ooh, I made a wish list 
I just need a bad B to do the dishes

M11 in a bruck down motor, one-way trip to Martin's sofa 
Lost everything, felt like I had no one, sat stressed out on Martin's sofa 
I done my first show, had to spud the promoter, head straight back to Martin’s sofa 
I pray when the fame and the charting's over, I ain't gotta end up on Martin's sofa

Wintеr night, it's the 6th October
If I had a one wish for my birthday, it would be some more ten-ten yola 
I’m in the bando, there's no California 
I'm tryna count these twenties up sober
The ding-dong bait, no insurance 
One more sale 'til the reload’s over, I'm tryna make a crack fiend turn chauffer 
My intention's innocent, this bando's small but I'm dreamin' big 
It was attempted M first time I was faced with the CPS 
I built my first hood phone losing, the gang asked me why I'm OT juggin' 
'Cause I'd rather sit down for the food than bootings 
Yo , every day these birds just get more stupid 
Bro got an eight for the mash, no sweets, and now he gotta wait 'til he's free, gluten 
OT boy, but when I come to the hood, I cause a nuisance 
Had a hammer on me, it come like I'm tryna do home improvements 
It's a double life and I'm workin' two shifts, Monday, I'm tryna be a college boy, Friday, on a Northwest train from Euston 
Yeah, I fucked up my attendance
I put a two and a blue with magic, I made it assemble like the Avengers
Pa always said I'm useless 
My first day in Scotland, I made me two quid

I'm feelin' like EST 'cah everyone shine together 
Course, the 9 can't flick like we, big lip look like he don't have a tenner 
I won't lie to the industry, somebody don't love their members
Look in the mirror and ask yourself if you've been in the trenches, pussy
Yo, who's your opps? Can't be us 
Pree the block, must be bruck 
Pree the board, must be mad
They get it online, not back in blood 
Can't be hate, must be love 
Can't be beef, must be brunch 
You're involved? Can't be much 
Where you from? Must be cunch 

SJ got half of the 9 on his shank, startin' to feel like a TBT 
So I give my young boys the four-by-four, tell them to go to the L, not 3x3 
They see me and wanted some clout, I rose the crime rate, ask the BBC 
They had to go next block for the GBG
See a man get slapped like he just went and made a G.I. Jane joke on G-A-N-G 
I jeeted out shh and it won't get leaked
She know her secret is safest with me 
Tell the jakes, "Free man up"
Who shot shh? Can't be Bug 
All of this bine, like, get chucked
I knew soon someone will run out of luck
