2 and a Q, 63 grams in the Pyrex bowl 
Slow cook with the fire on low 
I'm feeling like Tony flying this snow 
Trapping ain't dead, young boys still flying up O 
Whip in the kitchen, scrape that bowl 
I'm David Blaine with the magic, 2 and a Q from an O 
No face no case when I'm banging
Get it done like "who's gonna know?" 
I play Ace when I'm trapping
Hit the strip that food's gotta go 

Kitchen flaming hot when the yola's cooking 
Did a bowl and fork, we ain't making pudding 
I don't know about breaks, all year I'm jugging 
And don't rap like you take them risks, when you know you wouldn't 
Cats dem phone, that work still goes, no credit 
All a nigga knows is buy and sell it 
All year I just bruck down Bobby, now I'm Valentino stepping 
K splash if a 12 rips, that ain't no usual denim 
Even though I just get this bread, a machine I'll press it 
Mash on the pitch from long time, grip my machine with tekkers 
Slap that suttin off one time , and have some idiots jetting
Since then everyone calls me to shoot now
I'm feeling like Kaylum Dennis 
All day I've been serving shots, I ain't played no tennis 
Got my young boys doing that corner
Come like your local chemist 
It's far from a bag of weed when it's smoky settings 
12-gauge looking all legless, tap that twice and kweff it 


2 and a Q, 63 grams in the Pyrex bowl 
Slow cook with the fire on low 
I'm feeling like Tony flying this snow 
Trapping ain't dead, young boys still flying up O 
Whip in the kitchen, scrape that bowl 
I'm David Blaine with the magic, 2 and a Q from an O 
No face no case when I'm banging
Get it done like "who's gonna know?" 
I play Ace when I'm trapping
Hit the strip that food's gotta go

I'm on Edgware Road with a gorgeous one and shisha smoke
Pocket rocket, one inside my expensive coat
Still see me with M and Rose, or see me with M and Rose
That's 18k's and waps, that's racks and water froze
I'm in a bando, one up 2 Pyrex's full of yay
If they kick this door then the kitchen window's my escape
Might see me with M, or M that Skeng, or thats M.A
Owe the plug like 18k, and still bought an 18k

I woke up and made 5 quid
Celebrate with cookie
Still see me with M thats no ifs, buts or would-be's
Cowboy like Woody
It cost me a arm and a leg but I fire this pin and burn this hoodie
Got me a brand new whip
Brand new bitch, brand new wap
Young fly boy getting paid off rap and fucking up council flats
LD still pull up on wass
2-5 shots do it and dash
Dem man dere's pockets are brass
And all now they talk about waps
I'm on Edgware Road with my burner
I just got off the phone to my worker
With a brownin, she a hot one
Diamonds turn her to a squirter
Just linked Skeng he's a anti don with a 18k and a blikky
Drop top Merc with some g's in the side
Slow drive through Bricky 


I'm on Edgware Road with a gorgeous one and shisha smoke

Slithering snakes, how much time can I cut this grass
Four pipes on this 4x4
You can hear it roar when I'm cutting past
Don't ask what I do with the slab
No hammer and chis'
I chop this brick like Jackie Chan


Before you bust that brick, best cover your nose and shut those blinds
Count these rackers, now I can shut my eyes
Wake and bake, that's coke that's cooking
I put my life on the line even though I know I shouldn't
Italian kicks and clothes, I'm stepping clean from a kitchen stove
I can get you a brick of snow but after that's sold, I'll switch my phone
I don't want no traces
I feel the obbo watching, I know they want new cases

Just counted up this week's profits
You know when you made so much, you forgot your losses
Trap be a man's main topic
Put it under the tap and lock it
Bando pebbling brandy, this whisky ain't from Scotland
I was at home on JobSite
Then I went and built me a hotline
Now it's DSQ and Off-White
I'm on Brompton Road with a hot spice
Get the fork, come batter this fish
No we ain't making cod pies
Bro took a trip to the garden, then he came back with frostbite
Slithering snakes, how much time can I cut this grass
Young days I was going on movies, not once did they cut me half
But it's funny how things can change
Now the trap goes insane
Four pipes on this 4x4, you can hear it roar when I'm cutting past
Now the girls wanna know, I laugh
Says she want a man with a mask
She don't even know the half
But she don't even need to know it
She just want a jeet and blow it
And she love how the K's just frozen


Before you bust that brick, best cover your nose and shut those blinds
Count these rackers, now I can shut my eyes
Wake and bake, that's coke that's cooking
I put my life on the line even though I know I shouldn't
Italian kicks and clothes, I'm stepping clean from a kitchen stove
I can get you a brick of snow but after that's sold, I'll switch my phone
I don't want no traces
I feel the obbo watching, I know they want new cases

Bro, man's gone out the last three nights, yeah
And every time man step out
I go to the DJ, "I got a bill for you if you can run K-Trap, Warm"
Bro, I swear on my mother's life
I think it's one of the greatest to ever come out of our count—
I swear, like bro, do you know what it is?
You know where you made it, you might not appreciate it
Like, your fans, blud!



I stopped rapping and reoffended 
You know when the trap needs mendin' 
Too much mix in the Brizzy , you know when the pack needs blendin' 
Buy it, cop it, tell me who shottin' it, thе gangs are spendin'
You nevеr beat the mash off one hand 
After the bootin' , your hand's all tremblin' 

Too much cap I'm hearin', too much swag they wearin' 
And they ain't bought no hammers
That's so backwards, man, that's scary 
Shootouts in the winter, lettin' off bine and my eyes all teary
My football boots been dirty 
You can't rap like that, you ain't certi 
Only time I step out naked is when I’m fresh out the en-suite 
I know I'm a rapper, I'm sorry to say "It's on me" 
Pocket, rocket, lock it, shorty thinks it's fake 
Great, she don't know that I try get man in his face 
If I fire this .4 in the neighbourhood
You gonna hear goodness grace 
If I bust this brick in the kitchen
Listen, you gonna need two, three plates 
Prada drops 'cause I'm proud of bae
This one's long, but small like Nafe
Pick up them cases, don't want a case 


Out here on the block and you know we're warm

Feds wanna search for hammers
I know that they hope they're warm 
Two L's, show enough to the bells
Only go when the corn gets warm 
Phone call from bae as well
Home soon, make sure it's warm

Yea
Yea, I better hit dat
You don't understand bro
Listen



Everyday I got paper plans 
Tell me a day I ain't weighing grams 
Turn 4 into 9
I'll be pissed if I break this hand 
I see bro get a hammer and chisel 
All just to break this slab 
Two bricks of the AM just stinking
It's kinda awks if I take this cab 
Drop a half and a 9 to Mish 
AB wants a thousand grams 

Phone up the workers and round up cash 
Step in the kitchen, box of the maj 
Just looking like powdered yam
I just sent out a thousand texts
I might end up with a blocked sim 
I was sitting on the dock, two hands on my lap
Yeah the Trident had me boxed-in 
Tell me if you think you could sit in my seat
Hear 14-to-life and not sing 
Yeah I said 14-to-life and not sing 
I see bro get his timepiece bussdown 
Big face with da hella rocks in 
I hit da town with the straightest drop 
Why you think that hella shots ring? 
If Chase pulls up in the S
Leathers all red, bet your bitch hops in 

Yeah I bet that your bitch hops in 
All this weight that I move
And I still need to jump in the gym 
Spot a opp, I'll jump out the ride 
And let the 4 corn run with da wind 
A man stole that word, that was mine 
But I let dem man run with the ting 
All my nigga does is boxes 
And he ain't never jumped in the ring
You ain't never been in a nasty bando
And thought you'd be better with a 9 to 5 
You ain't ever boshed the hell out the pack
And still sold that 9 for 5 
You ain't ever got a phone call 'bout a drop
And said nah you ain't got time for the hype 
But 20 minutes later find yourself outside
With a big 4-4 in the ride 
I ain't gotta talk too much
When it's time I'll get them punks 
Tell Screws bring 25 shots 
These shots won't get you drunk 
5th corn too dangerous
It don't pierce, it's taking chunks 
Hit a boy up and forget it 
Next day I'll take bae for lunch 
Out 'ere everyday, this shit's gotta pay 
'Member dat day, caught a chase from the gunboys
They're pissed that Mish got away 
On the phone to Skeng every night
Three years that bro's been away 
When he's home, he's back
He just wants a new wap and an all-gold 18k 

I'm in Harvey Nichs, then we get the D-squared
Then a 34 or 6 
I'm on the phone to the plug
And he's talking 'bout 34 for a 36 
I got alotta of the dinners and orders
This week alone I done 30 whips 
Just imagine if all of my bros had 30 clips 
I just got me a half of B 
Now I'm tryna find where I can lock dis' 
Fling it in a bowl
I need a whole lotta' ice just to lock dis' 
In the trap playing Bags &amp; Boxes 
Tryna help bro bag these boxes 
A boy tried taking bro for a joke 
Till he got mad then cocked it 
I was on bail tryna make it all
Till I got locked up and lost it 
Two drills and they both intense 
I'm surprised me and bro never lost it 
A boy pissed that we won dat wand 
You woulda thought me and bro woulda lost it

But I do it for my guys that took it to trial to fight and lost it

Took it to trial and lost it
Roll to the dough I got shawty with me
Thick thighs kinda short and pretty
She was shy at first but I don't blame her, she didn't know about the life so I taught her quickly
And even thought the life seems sorta sticky, she seeing past that and said she wanna sort it with me
And she ain't fussed about the foreigns with the new spec, fuck a ride she said she don't mind walking with me
So it's only right I gotta pattern her, like new bag alert blow a bag on her
Racks in elastic she telling me I flatter her
Fronts fantastic but you should see the back on her
She knows I'm the truth and I won't let her down
And I'm the only man she's gonna let around
Night time pull up at hers, she's in her dressing gown
Clubs real lit, but the two of us' a better crowd
Step in style, she caught the drift and got the hang of it
And she knows about the trap, told me to balance it
But I don't think she knows about this wap and why I carry it
To tell the truth babe, I don't wanna get into it
Cos you forget 'bout all of that soon as I get into it
Love me cah I'm fly and the bread I'm really getting to it
But I let the money talk ain't gotta say it now
Young and fly, why you think she wanna stay around?


It's really money over bitches with you
But I'm not a bitch, so I have your head all confused
Moncler for the cold and your fly is matching me boo
You know I love my Nikes, but you got me stepping in Loubs
Yeah I see you're young, wild and winning
All I see you're young, wild and winning
Yeah I see you're young, wild and winning
Pray to Lord, to forgive you for your sins
Yeah I see you're young, wild and winning
All I see you're young, wild and winning
Yeah I see you're young, wild and winning
We won't stop this is just the beginning

Stamping out a packet in my Louis runners, trapline still doing numbers
I could push it all in one or break the pack down, only winning niggas in my traphouse
Only drilly niggas on the street corners, unruly type of guys that rebuke orders
27 onions that's 3 corners, brick looking like it crossed over 3 borders
Peng like the gyal I wanna jeet down, only mummy and the plug be on speed dial
Cooking daily but I still gotta eat out
Calamari or a crab salad, I could tell you 'bout the times it was just Dallas
But it changed when I worked hard
Now I put in 3 goals by the first half
Coming heavy right now, it's just the first draft


Went and done it even though they couldn't see it in me
I'm a rapper now my runner grab the re-up for me
Street certified, they nod when a G passes
Bring the gold bottles, we don't need glasses
We only gonna pour it for the sake of it
I know the trap's wrong, but look what I made off it
She didn't wanna know and now she wanna stay a bit
And this ain't for a moment cos we staying lit


Cocaine Yeezys on a Merc brake, Givenchy what the shirt says
T-shirt with a pattern cost a Z of cali
Drippy nigga with a flipping bally
I'm that guy that made a nigga wanna buy a 'rex
And this music got me busy so I fly it less
1 week made 10 thou by text, on the phone to Rose where we flying next?
And it's anyday,  probably MIA
You gotta love life, loved ones I hug mine
And I appreciate the fuck ups cos you live and learn
Ain't a day I go without a figure earnt
Cah I'm really in the streets when I shouldn't
T-house jugging, with this half key of dirt
And everyday it hasn't changed, new day it's still the same
Kiss my sugar on the forehead and hit the curb

110 on the dash, on the way to the cash, watch out for the ANPs
Louis V on the pedal and the Matte says AMG
Pretty little ting for the trip der
Gonna help me bring a half brick dere
Said she want shoes and a handbag
Duffel bag and this ram pack
I just wanna get A to B, B to A
I just wanna get A to B, B to A
Before I take that trip
I pray that I make it back cah the streets ain't safe
I just wanna get A to B, B to A

I just wanna fly this pack in peace, without pigs giving me grief
Cos if I get stung with this, that's 8 or a 6 to 3 the least
That's a whole load of swag, cash and waps if you're talking about me
And if you're talking bout the T, then I'm 2 scales deep in grease in beat
Young boy, it was bikes and paper
Never would have thought i would brake this quarter key right down with the razor
Never would have thought I'd be out in the block with the dots, 2 bells and a laser
But its mad how times can change
Now its no miles and nuttin but smells on a starter and drive this range
110 on the dash on the way to the cash with a baddest
Told her controll this package
After were gonna go Harrods
She wanna buy heels and dresses
Told her walk to the till no stresses
And after it's back to the stretches stove and the 2 Pyrexes
Baby I'm young and wreckless
She told me she  Bad and Boujee
Showed her the diamonds, dial on the new p's
Now she wanna make movies
But theres no time for sets cah the satnav without where we driving next
Hiding everything, gotta drive correct
If I don't, then I'm likely to find a pen


110 on the dash, on the way to the cash, watch out for the ANPs
Louis V on the pedal and the Matte says AMG
Pretty little ting for the trip der
Gonna help me bring a half brick dere
Said she want shoes and a handbag
Duffel bag and this ram pack
I just wanna get A to B, B to A
I just wanna get A to B, B to A
Before I take that trip
I pray that I make it back cah the streets ain't safe
I just wanna get A to B, B to A

Harlem Spartans, Kennington Sergeants
Step to your block I'm marching
Harlem Spartans, Kennington Sergeants
Step to your block I'm marching


Got me feeling Misch Porter
True say I might step with Harlem
I'm a hundred with gang
And by myself I'm spartan
Them man there doing up bench
Cause they ain't aiming on target
I don't know about tactics
But I'm up front like Marcus 
Trying to get a big man drowned, why little bro rolls we splash
Or 10 toes with this smoke, dash corn then I dash
Ring, ring trap trap
Make a show bout Misch and Mash
Like how you doing road
When you ain't seen no cash

Nah man two pedal bike, that's 4 man go, 5 man stay
No mask, just throw me a shirt, cut that up I can't catch no case
In the whip just crash him
For the p's man mashing
That's him not splashing
Got teeth throw damage
That's corn in cobs
Or teeth in gums
Make p's in slums
Phone beating drums
Get hoes and clothes
And anything else that's underneath can get it
I got dirty notes
I link dirty guys in a dirty track
No time for a bath
Man sleep and trap I need this cash


Life is a bitch in this world that we in but I still gotta fight for my soul
Finesse and stack or invest in a trapper book that flight and go O
I do white like Family Guy and I do up the dark like Cleveland Show
In Harlem chilling with bro, get the drop on the opps so we hit that show
Skr, skr my drivers a pro
We get to the show, driver stop, step out, relegate man like Hull
I fear no man but Allah
Come on
Step in the whip lets go
Smoke, smoke off get smoked
Why scream gang, get bored on your own

You niggas weren't sitting down for this
Niggas never had no feds on their back, they weren’t in no war
They weren't flying no birds
Slay Products


Feel to just take this mask off, everyone confused there
Talking wass and hiding face, and I step and stone to music
Everyday I hear man talk reckless, ruthless, now man's gotta prove it
And if I rap ’bout bootings, it's cah I been booting
And if I rap 'bout bricks, it's 'cause I've got a 36 in a stash box
4 and a door in a crack pot, still tryna download beats on a laptop
How long have I been juggling both?
Studio time and a engine, nearing a Pyrex bowl and stove
Hit that show, I'm bringing the smoke even though man don't smoke 

Never done it for likes, couldn’t care about fame, why I hide my face
But there’s too much animosity around it cah them man copied and made it childish
And if you're talking setting trends, then that’s me and L
Hid my face cah then I tried do it with the .12, they don't want 'em to see and tell
Just met a new cell, talking A and B
Took my number, first time he came to re' he pulled up playing me
He didn’t even know I'm Trapo, bet if I tell him I'll make his week
Half a brick and a 9 of , dummy 9, I made a key
Said she wanna take this D, I told her "maybe", I made her week
Showed her what a man made this week, now she wanna shave the beat
I just make her top it, I ain't gotta ask her who's real, it's obvious
A thousand G's on the counter, treat it like the dotty and chop it
Chop it, chop it down, hit water, it's locking now
Where you get that 'matic from? I don't know, the lost and found
Where you get that package from? I don't know, I think abroad
Took man lightly, now we're in a Ford tryna fill 'em with corn


Feel to just take this mask off, everyone confused there
Talking wass and hiding face, and I step and stone to music
Everyday I hear man talk reckless, ruthless, now man's gotta prove it
And if I rap 'bout bootings, it's cah I been booting
And if I rap 'bout bricks, it's 'cause I've got a 36 in a stash box
4 and a door in a crack pot, still tryna download beats on a laptop
How long have I been juggling both?
Studio time and a engine, nearing a Pyrex bowl and stove
Hit that show, I'm bringing the smoke even though man don't smoke
