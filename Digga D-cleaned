Cop it, lock it, sell it
Rob it, fly it
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain’t diet


Whip it, set it
Flick it, cheff it
Cop it, chop it, press it 
Cop it, lock it, sell it 
Rob it, fly it 
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain't diet 

You know-you know seh the gun them buss
Lean, lean with the gun like Russ
No one ain’t dyin', they're lyin' on us
No carb in the yard then I'm flyin' it dust 
Truss, no loyalty, she's linin' ’em up
No royalty, your queen give it up
Cheff chest and back, I’m leavin' him rubbed 
Up and down, no seesaw
Detour, oi, dodge that nee-naw
I got six and if you add three more
Then I’m somewhere where I might get recalled
And I'm tired of seein' the can
Whole ting get shell down

Got the fairy .44, big bang 
Bro don't box like Joshua, shank game popular
Do man proper, shotta
Throw me a box and I got ya
Man take risks for the pounds and prosper
Prosper, they had me in the can like Foster
Let the Star buck for the cream, no Costa 
That nigga don’t really want beef
Who's copyin' me? Some silly imposter


Whip it, set it
Flick it, cheff it
Cop it, chop it, press it 
Cop it, lock it, sell it 
Rob it, fly it 
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain't diet 
Whip it, set it

'ight, look, yo


She want the long dick, long dick, the daddy dick 
Turn off her jaws, I'm gonna savage it
Damage it and now she can't walk, that's some cabbage shit 
Stroke the pussy, when I scratch, she can't manage it 
I won't eat her pussy, bring another bitch to eat, though 
Freak hoes , deepthroat 
What you mean who I'm with? I'm with three bros 
She wanna do all three, Migos 
After I get the blows, 6:30, IVD touch her toes
When she's coming to the crib, she ain't wearing no clothes
And I get a better sight, so I'm taking her phones
Digga D, you'rе lit
I been fly, been fly
"Why you cummin' quick?"
Been type, been type
And I'ma keep stroking, creampiе, creampie
Let me clean you up
Clean type, clean type


Fresh trim, grey tracky, grey tracky
She loves a gunman that stays trappy
Fresh trim, grey tracky, grey tracky
She loves a gunman that stays trappy

Mad About Bars
I know you lot have been waiting for this one
Ghosty
And believe me we ain't leaving, until we got another classic
So Digga D, let's give the streets what they really want
Mad About Bars, we're back
Cut tru' Digga


If they get nicked with the cannon
They won't stay real and sing like Mariah
Conspire to change my attire
Rise that fryer and burn that liar
Bro known rider
He got down three and they all turned choir
And prior, prior, prior to this sixteen or higher
The opps turned bro to a lifer
300s, leathers on, no biker
And I was the only guy my age in West London with a sniper
See a man's eyes roll back from a chest shot attack
Free broski Striker
Or I press on a one .32
But I ain't tryna find out my number on Lyca
Them man act for the net
But that's not how they are off set
And when me and my amigos pull up
They take off, make off, they're wet
Still bake off where shh got cheffed
Trap pays off, I still get bread
No days off, I miss my bed
Still blaze off, ay, fling that lead
Who's dem yutes? Spin that ped
Do it like Bruce, ching that head
I learnt from Cruz now I bring back Zs
Bro drop mad work, that weight get benched
Do it like Ratlin, hop that fence
But I bet you still get ching-ching
So it don't make no sense
So it don't make no sense
Got a pack just in, that's Bieber
On a Friday battering fish
But the Sunday coming ain't Easter
Little bro don't know how to whip
He wants white wash, no FIFA
He told me he got it on tick
Ay, take that shit and go buy a new beater
Caasis, caasis, the akhis call us caasis
Askar tryna raid mans guri, they want man back in xabsi
Grab the xabad, I'm charged up fully
Mask and hoodie, jump out the passy
Really tryna bullet that boy
No Walters, I ain't doing up Ashley
I look psychotic when man get wassy
I need me a stain, now I'm searching, Finding Nemo
Add bash to the Bobby
See man got brown, no Nino
His silk gon' cut when I back that smoke
The nurse ain't using chemo
Don got dipped cah he tried run
I caught him a stitch, no Lilo
How much do you wanna B-E-T if I step on a Five with a Star
Suttin' gon' end up on BBC if I tell bro stop that car
Film in the four, two guns, take one, we're rolling
Lights, camera, action, cut-cut when I soak him
Ian's proper, every morning phones my blower
Food on fleek, take two of each, I call that Noah
Twelve for a oner, or take more, I don't go no lower
And if Drip don't answer his phone
Then I'm all alone tryna bring back yola
Pyrex living, Pyrex whipping
Splash in the kitchen, get it back over
Brown and cute like Keisha
I can't lie Lisa, a real life moaner
Been getting these P's, ten point five of the baking soda
She wan' jump up, mash up the place
Pallance bitch, this ain't no soca

Yo, look


Fresh home, still using a kettle to whip, this fish ain't nothin' like tuna
Would've been more than meddling kids if Kruger taught me to whip up sooner
I don't trap with melanin kids, the rumour is Digga D is a groomer
I just mixed two five two with sixty, the boy Adz just ran for a tuna
And that's actually factual
Pyrex filled with oil, in jail, mixed that with mackerel
In Feltham using foil, in big man jail, man broke my capsule
ZK shoulda been at school, he left that place when cats called
Why? We all sold, drugs it's natural
Jheeze, I just got released
No more selling bariis, or hearing the govs with keys
And now I can rest in peace 
Just like my paigons, it's haram for us to eat pork
But it ain't haram for them to get bacon, don't get cooked or shaven
Been in the field like Niko Bellic, real yard man like Jacob 
Don't get chopped like Franklin's dog cah your soul might just get taken
Not green but Grove, my opps are broke
They ain't ballers, it's blatant
We got a CJ from Grove as well, but we ain't in San Andreas 
Jojo got an L plate, he ain't even got his provisional license 
Watch me whip this skeng and his head back jerk pin drop, that's nothing but silence
Five guys step on violence, GBK get bun, no Byrons
My young boys do what I say, I'm Simon, charged up and vibrant
We ain't sharing a drink when I let that sky, watch his head back tilt
They had my man cold outside, had to cover that kid in a quilt
She lined me and her juice got spilt, I lost no sleep, I don't feel no guilt
Ah shit, she need some milk, case dismissed before it got built
I got a dotty off one of my EastEnders but the son of a gun's not Nick
The queen that I want ain't Vick but I still make that on the square like Mick
My little shooter's in his prime time, if I send him now, TV at six 
Like, how's he got so much talk on the 'net? Like he ain't been touched with a flicks
Old school days never had me a Rollie, I bought that aqua fresh 
I told her  "I want Oral B", now she's all on me and she's making a mess
She said that it's big for a slender, easy, I'm tender, don't undress
Ejaculate in her mouth or pull out, ejaculate on her breast, yes

M1OnTheBeat
Damn, Cee done it again
Big dripper
Magnum sipper, no nail clipper
Free Luga Vellz
That ammi smells
And bitch, no, I won't cut my nails  


Who's that my man? 
Jump out, fry man 
Why's he leaving his right hand? 
Ayy, come back and back your boy 

Jump out, rise this toy 
Jump out, rise this toy 
Jump out 
Who's that my man? 
Jump out, fry man 
Why's he leaving his right hand? 
Ayy, come back and back your boy 

Jump out, rise this toy 
Jump out, rise this toy 
Jump out 

Yo
This is the old flow, mans bringing it back

Pass the soda, let me turn it to crack

This is the old flow, mans bringing it back
Wrap the tracks up, I'm clinging up crack
Ah, TraceO


My whole team gettin' bread and you know that 
I brought the old "Packages" flow back 
If she ain't new, then she can't get a throwback 
I don't follow back chicks, and they know that 
I came tru' with 21 tugs in black and they let the ting "glee", like Kodak 
My opponents are broke and they show that 
If she stepped in with me, gotta' hold that 

Yo, akh, bring that "Next Up" flow back
Throwback, no cap, that pack's low fat
Told that, my man won't get his cro back
None of his dough back, I don't give no chat
Real .39 stamp suttin', bro post that
This hooch here man got it off Polacks
Don’t give no chat and have no wap
When man sniper gang like I’m Kodak


Look, I locked up the food for the kids like Boris 
And then I let it go like Rashford 
Free SQ, Free Shankz, that's standard 
Feds take the mandem, got the block angered 
Stepped in the dance, sat down, got pampered 
Big back gyal, 'nuff weight, she's anchored 
Dot chopped to a half length, it's tampered 
.40 don't crumble, now he's in a Backwoods 


Slap that PR, I saw them crouch 
If you save them shots like my man did 
Pronounce, I won’t hear ouch 
Been about, the opps can vouch 
Spin around bring the Glocks dem out 
Lift it up, lick the paigons down 
I feel like a clown
But you know what I mean 
When I make man drown 
Had a plug then I would buy a hundred waps 
Me and AJ two AP's, facts, more than a hundred racks
Dappz, Digga, Shotty on tap
Weed, molly, lean, crack
I get that gone bring the stacks dem back 
What is this track?
Turn that off man, that’s nuttin’ but cap

We outchea 
Besta
Beja, besta
Tek off your drawers
You know
Yo


Ayy, back your bro, don't spectate
He watched when I digged at his best mate's chestplate
White tent wanna lock off that estate
I bet say if corn get fling, that's red tape 
Violent, violent, let man tone it
I had shh and that like "Where's my waps?"
Duh, course I stole it
She chat too much, but the next one hold it 
Told them "Don't get comfy in Golborne”
Bruck that dots, had thе back bit open
Left in the rain, now thе sweets dem swollen
Now I'm rollin', handgun, shells golden
Five door hatchback, lurk in the Astra
Five man dash back, might be a hashtag
Lay low, bro just chinged up F****
Yo, I really wanna kill this gasbag
I told little Stizzy to go be the lookout 
Cah I ain't tryna lose this telly
Ask Unknown T, my celly
If I had my man lookin' like Nelly
I chinged my man on house block four
Turn that wing to a Hotspur 
No Tottenham but it came from a farm
Same size as my arm, it's a Mossberg

See a opp right thurr
And get chingy, chingy, chingy 
My gun dem with me, my gun den fi me
Give me my thingy and let me get flingy 
Ya see it? Ya zimme? 
We got a big dilemma
Bait main road, bro don't know better
Looked at bro like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"
He let that go like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"
Bait main road like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"
It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever 


Yo, whatever the weather, I'm steppin' whenever
I'm madder than ever
Ruin his sweater, put two in the 'Retta
They're copyin' me 'cause I'm doin' it better
Left my block with the pum pum rev out
Can't come in 'til the killy dem dead up
One hand in, can't get the left leg up
They're drawin' me in, they don't want me to step out
Wait, that's him, I swear? 
Where? Right thurr 
Jump out, try put him in a coffin
Hop back in and swerve
Where's my 'yac? 
I'm burst 
Last night was a blur 
Pree the watch , burr 
I'm about to go clear

Yeah
Don't get it twisted, you know
My dad's from East
Which makes me a real geezer, fella
Someone get me a fucking Stella 


Get me white-boy wasted 
Get me lit, get me pissed, get me faded
Get the condoms, get the gyaldem naked
Want the long john, it's the dick that she tasting 
Now she hot like a basin 
Don't say it, just save it 
All my shoes got laces 
Don't mek badman blaze it 
Anytime that I jump on a beat like this
Gotta shout AJ 'cah that flow is his
Evеry other day, I get stopped by CID's
Still mix Amnesia weed with cigs 
This the loudest there is, is
I just snuck in my nizz, don't make me lock the ting, it's a chizz
Bubble that, double that, juggle that 
Double back, double tap, rubble that 
Shuffle back, unzip the duffle bag 
Now-now he's in trouble, akh, shovel that
P's from that trap, I don't trouble that 
Put down a hunnid racks 
JSav, that's my brother that, brother that
We ain't cheffing bro we're gunnin' that, gunnin' that

I-I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun
If you try to run, I'm kweffing you, I-I shoot my gun
I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun
If you try to run, I'm kweffing you, I-I shoot my gun


Oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I do
Oh, oh, fessi-ession 'fessions too
Oh, oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I too
Oh, oh, fessi-ession, do come true


Ayy, it's the morning, I'm still drunk, buss it, aight? Ayy


White boy wasted crew and we roll in cars, ragging them like they're stolen
Barbies bleach blonde, Phil Foden
Makin' them scream that "It's comin' home" and that 
I told Digga to roll with that 
'Cause I'm so fuckin' off my nut, I might just lack
I don't shoot no wap, beer bottles get smashed
So let's have it 
You don't wanna party with ArrDee, none of 'em hack it 
It's litty for really, it's silly, if you got a drink and I see it, I'll back it 
Necking it off just like the gyal in my bed that I've got
Tun up with tugs and geezers', the lot
My own family think I've lost the plot, I don't give a toss
Leave the girl breathing heavy, easy, steady 
I don't know about stayin' out late, 'cause I party 'til the sunrise
This boy, have the cab man screaming 
It's litty for really, a whole bag of noise
The vibes in the room but Digga's too loose
Heard man say

Ahem
Nah, I'm done
Huh?
Ayo, Trinz
You're toxic
Hahaha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say nuttin'
Hahaha
I'm toxic, you're toxic, let's be toxic together, bitch
Look, yo


You get it? 'Cause I don't 
Would you hit it? 'Cause I won't 
Whole heap of gyal on my iPhone
Influencers that wanna suck my bone
I do it for all of the niggas that DM these bitches, and get left on read 
This blue tick make it easy to hit but more time I just get head 
She wasn't there when I was in jail, she never sent me no mail 
More time it's footballer dick that she taking but she love the rappers as well 
I bucked her in tape, I bucked her in pong, if only if you knew what these models are on 
The second that man got recalled, all of these models was gone 
She at my table leeching, takin' snaps and tryna get me in 
About 1942, your chest too high, is that how you're feeling?
Won't get more than a Magnum and a Magnum for this beating 
Ask if me and Shar speaking, it don't make sense 'cause you're still on jeeting

I went jail and the shooting stopped, came back out and it started again
Let me ask you a question, who you think's really blasting their skengs?
The popo think it's us, 'cause it sure as hell ain't them
And whenever the corn get buss, they kick up a fuss and blame my friends

And whenever the corn get buss, they kick up a fuss and blame my friends

Popo kicked in the door, found so much grub in the yard and seized it 
They know it ain't personal use, I ain't smoking food so they nicked me for PWITS 
T-T, not remixed, glide with heart, man do it and mean it 
Step for the K like nizz, bro jacked her son, MJ then Jean'd it 
The .32 spinner, it's dirty, still bareback that slut, no rubbers 
Truss, you don't wanna get stung cah pills won't help that burn, on my mothers 
Rambisha left man leaking, still discharge, that's dirty lovers
Pull out and buss, no fuss, truss, I take the risk for my brothers 
And hang out the ride like my man from Boyz n the Hood and slap that gauge 
I just sold eight in seven days, I want it in loaf like Dej
OT trips, T-T, no ticks, three bags change for twenty one days
There's no way you're a savage, you got no heart like 21 says 
Just got a call from Ian, he said that he wants three B 
Wrap it in rizz, that's orange, just got a four so I need three G's 
Bro just got a O too, he wants me to wash it, I'll do it for free 
I'll make this T mobile and live in the whip with light and B
