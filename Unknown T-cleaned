It's Unknown T, Homerton B
I've got gyallie on me
Opp block, bally on me
Panic and dash
Dem boy run and retreat
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
Gyallie on me
Bally on me
Panic and dash

Samurais in batches
Whack, whack, pull up, skrrt, reverse
Bang, the ting goes back in the jacket
Hope the clip or the spin' make him backflip
When it comes to the trap
All my niggas work off the magic
Got that 10 out of 10 and it's banging
Apart from the tragics, listen
I was on the backroad picking my cats
Nike tracksuit, and a 'fuck off' hat
Girls-girls move then come back
Her tits went out when she saw my stack
Pull up, pull up where it is or jaft
Wanna go home?
Tell that bitch call cab
How could you make that your darling one?
When that Barbie's lookin' like Bratz, and
How could you make that your hubby?
Empty tummy, that nigga eat brass 
Went on a meal den dashed
Listen, look
Baby, bend ya' back and then dig it
Dig it, bend ya' back and then dig it
Back and then dig it, gyal want more dickin'
Back in one minute, bag up that spinach

Led through the mist
By the milk-light of moon
All that was lost is revealed
Our long bygone burdens
Mere echoes of the spring
But where have we come?
And where shall we end?
If dreams can't come true
Then why not pretend?

How the gentle wind
Beckons through the leaves
As autumn colors fall
Dancing in a swirl
Of golden memories
The loveliest lies of all
I believe what I say
Why does everyone hear me wrong?
If I told you different, would it sound the same?
Would it make a difference in anyway? Oh, no
I know I done wrong, I'll pay for it
It's your turn to talk, for once I'm listenin'


Say that you don't want me
Say that you don't need me
Tell me I'm the fool
Tell me you've been tortured
Tell me you've been beaten
And what I've done to you
Even if it doesn't matter
Matter what's true
Say that you don't want me
Say that you don't need me
Tell me I'm the fool


Look at all this heartache, what is left?
Forgetting how it started, this is how it ends, oh no
I know I've done some wrong, I'll pay for it
But it's your turn to talk, for once I'm listening

I pack my case. I check my face
I look a little bit older
I look a little bit colder
With one deep breath, and one big step, I move a little bit closer
I move a little bit closer
For reasons unknown


I caught my stride
I flew and flied
I know if destiny’s kind, I’ve got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don’t see you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you no more

For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown


There was an open chair
We sat down in the open chair
I said if destiny’s kind, I’ve got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don’t see you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you at all


For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown


I said my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to and my eyes don’t recognize you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you no more


For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
Heard them lil' threats you sent, they don't mean shit
I'm in the trap on some green shit
Got my unc' on the stove with a mean wrist
Got a bitch in my bed on some freak shit
Come and take your lil' pack on some free shit
Had to pray for a check, on my knees shit
All this jewelry on me, I can freeze shit
Ain't no "I" in team, we on some "we" shit
Did this shit on my own, I don't need help
Got the strap on my lap like a seatbelt
Secret service cars, I know how Meek feel
Had a lot of friends that ain't mean me well
Sellin' Gushers so I can feed my kids
Work so hard, I just did me like three shifts
Got four cars, nigga, I don't need no Lyft
Got two F&amp;N's and they on both hips
Got two sticks with me, but I got four clips
When I fuck her, I fuck her so focused
Shawty love me 'cause I don't take no shit
She gon' do what I say, I'm controlling
Baby girl, make sure that them legs open
I be cautious, ain't tryna see no pen', yeah
All this juggin', I just bought a new Benz, yeah
Said you was down, but you lied to me
Say you want smoke, but you hiding from me
I be spendin' 'cause no, you can't die with money

When you crossed me, it almost brought me to tears
Had to man up and go face all of my fears
And my chick from a whole 'nother hemisphere
In a foreign, you know that I'm switching gears
In the studio, I'm my own engineer
Need an addy for P's, you can send 'em here
Feel the walls closing in, I can tell it's near
All this loud in the house, I can barely hear
In designer, 12 locked me up, profiling
I be fresh as hell, I don't need no stylist
Got like 80K spread out in four pockets
Got some CPN CC's in my wallet
When she see them racks, she be like, "Damn, daddy"
And that BC shit, that there is my family
I'm on drank in the hotel in Miami
Finna buy me some land to grow out in Canton
Sold so much of it that people done took advantage
Wanna go away, wish I could go and vanish
On them drugs, I'ma go to another planet
If you not from the streets, you won't understand me
Niggas plotting on me, they so underhanded
She gon' come in the room with no bra and panties
All my P's gone, I'm feeling so fine and dandy
And the strain that I'm burning is Cotton Candy, yeah
My niggas animals, they ain't got no conscience
Burn a lil' nigga, I'm dialed in
Plus keep a stick for the freak shit
And I got a shop in the district
I was in the projects stressing
All these racks, they a blessing
Every night, I was clutching my weapon

I love Chris Rich


Bare residue in the air when it boots
Who's getting a twos ’cah the smoke too blemish 
When my Niners get 'round they dread it
Load that fryer, step 'round and shell it 
Bro might load that gauge then sneeze at your brain 
It’s a new pandemic
Jailhouse ting I was doin' up Snap
Marty and mash Voda' for the credit 


Put my foot in this whip 
Level up when I slap this stick 
Times two if I hit that prick 
Back road, move mad and move skits 
You see, Bankai wan' kill and chill 
Bigger the par, that's thrill and skill 
Insidious how the yute got poked 
Talk on my name, are you poppin' pills?


Bang for the team, would you bang the machine? 
Stay with a plan for the beef
See me on a casual, least a nank in my jeans 
For the bad talk, might dampen a tee 
Leave a weed factory clean
I could pay but of course I'm happy it's free 
Really move aggy on weed
We just take ours and get trappy with green

Opps can't fuck with da thug
We made the Tridents come
More time it's a Niner ting
I been that silent one
Opps can't fuck with da thug
We made the Tridents come
More time it's a Niner ting
I been that silent one
More time I've been complacent
But when bro got dropped
Fuck all the guap
I stepped out with no hesitation
Man lurk from the public station
Slow down 'cause there ain't no mistaking
And I've been tryna rake this cake in
You can never hold it down like man, 'cah my life's been aching
Police on my nuts it's fucked
Earnt that luck, cases bruck
Opps can't fuck with da thug
We made the Tridents come
And dis one look like an undie
Nuh, we dont supply that drug
In fact, do I look like a mug?
Word, man, rock on my stainless tucked
We don't do this monkey bar ting
Fence and get chinged
Bag that work with the latex on, the rack will come in
Again and again, the racks will come in
OT blingin', the phone keeps ringing
Circle your block, pop doors get chinging
Fuck dem opps, for the boy dem singing
That prick had a vicious dipping
How many nights had to bake in the Bando to get that guap?
I flew OT tryna lick that stain, so we hit that spot
Bag dat up, and serve 'dem dots
Opps can't mock 'bout guap
Man push work a lot
My old school gyal love the way man rock
Man flex on a bae like, "What?"
And true say man crept to the top
Hustle for days, I learnt both ways
Plug for the shape and the crops
It look like I come out the gym and I shot 
Look like I come out the gym and I shot
Listen
There's too much chat on the street, I've been itching to write man off
Bro got juice on my favourite shirt, so I burnt that top
Work that chef like it's Novikov
I've been on bail for the longest, more time Boydem gob
Man just sit in the dock, get released and I don't look bov'
The cops like; "How did he do that job?"

Unknown T
Lets do this Mad About Bars: Season three
But Unknown, seems like you got the streets talking about you and you ain't even put out a record yet
So it's only right
We go with the Mad About Bars first
'Cause, you know, my platform 
It's just a bit different

Take him in

Jheeze!


Look; listen, shh





Had a dot-dot up in the cab, got Polkas in bags
We soak him and dash
Bro-bro got the clique on waps
Beg man don't run, when they see that wap
Got the clique on mash
Beg man don't run, when they see that wap
Bro-bro got the clique on waps
Beg man don't run, when they see that mash
I had devilish thoughts when I witnessed the body get chopped
Banged the one pop
In fact, there's still spots in this spin ting
Come like them old school clocks
Listen
One lickle ching and they chat like kids
He got splashed, and he got cheffed
We didn't say shit
Gang just pop up and tape off strips
Real nigga shit
Pamper ting, buss off and take mans shit
Bumper ting, bruk' off and tek' some dick
She wants some more love
Just take a man in
Want some more love?
Just take a man in
Gyal must be licked if she thinks imma come to her crib
To get caught up and then get nicked
Don't forget, man got beef on your strip
Don't forget, man got beef on your strip
I done so much work on the low
I'm only young, mixing a pyrex bowl
Bussed the wap case and the Tridents know
Justice ain't right, but the jury don't
C.P.S. they know the justice ain't right, but the jury don't
C.P.S. they know the justice ain't right, but the jury don't
What you know about moving bookey?
Confusing the angle, 'cause I'm unpredictable
See this life that I live ain't fictional
In the system, we're labelled as. "Criminal"
All about money; don't care about beef
But few of these yutes have doubts
Don't care 'bout your name on street
If you're on me, I'm cheffing you inside out
And if I catch an M, I will fly out
Poke-poke chef, soak til' that yute dries out
If a boys got grub, then I will try out, sike
Your boy got yakked then bounced, twice
If I backed my shank on your friend
Ask yourself, "Should I be chillin' with dem?"
Bromley-by-hoe, give ten-out-of-ten
And she sniff coke, let me give it to dem
How could the feds try lock man for eighty hours and dat?
Rhaatid, it's mad
Whose that youte tryna move bare bad?
And my music's up, 'cause my views went mad
Bits get bagged, haffi' scale and lag
And free all da guys, locked up in the can
Bits get bagged, haffi' scale and lag
And free all da guys, locked up in the can
My babes-my babes, said I need rubber bands
Got too much notes in cash
But don't forget, man still gets paid in bands
Can't wait til' the payment lands
The way, the way that the phone just rang
Got seven missed calls at 3am, and it's only a Benz, like damn
Like, how can a man stress man?
Whose got heart lemme turn that off
Blood on creps, man burn that off
You ain't done shit on the pitch like Berbatov
Burn man off
I got bagged and I learned a lot
Chase racks, don't waste more time on a paigon block
I switched plans, now I'm making prof

Mm-hm
Merci, Miink, oh
Listen


Step out, don't pree up 'cause thats my goodums 
I gripped on two, so I cheated
I think I shouldn't, but know I should've
The C.I.D. can't chat to me, I'm so fluent, I dodged that bullet
Shit, this gyal wanted me, I would've
I would've put it all in a bruk like "boduff, wouduff"
Backshot like "douduff"

Anytime when a paigons ran in
Them man back whine, so their gyaldem manage
My last bitch weren't bangin', she does bare chattin'
Why she always jamming?
B, I got my young ting bag from early
She was trapped in a jury package
Star sign Scorpio, shawty sassy
And of course she damaged
Bells run shows down in O2 Arena
Hop out the car let me send man Arriba, Arriba
Ten toes step with the new .22, she my new ballerina
Black whip, let's tint out the car
Now you can't see me, your times up, John Cena
See me in the nina, Mamacita
Shawty, she my side chick, Shenseea


Step out, don't pree up 'cause thats my goodums 
I gripped on two, so I cheated
I think I shouldn't, but know I should've
The C.I.D. can't chat to me, I'm so fluent, I dodged that bullet
Shit, this gyal wanted me, I would've
I would've put it all in a bruk like "boduff, wouduff"
Uh, uh
Step out, don't pree up 'cause thats my goodums
I gripped on two, so I cheated
I think I shouldn't, but know I should've
The C.I.D. can't chat to me, I'm so fluent, I dodged that bullet
Shit, this gyal wanted me, I would've
I would've put it all in a bruk like "boduff, wouduff"
Backshot like "douduff"

Mmmhmm
Listen, look


Can't believe that I'm locked with the lifers
I was on seg, not basic, segregated from all of my Niners
I've never been jail but they caught man prior
You talk drill in a track, you're a liar
I suggest that you go retire 
Been a sec since I been on the curb
Can't fling me a bird, I'm a rider 
Prison governors try give me category A
Wait, but why? Cah my face too bait
I'm eatin' noodles from a plastic plate
Yet I'm still tryna G-check yutes from the 8
On soc', man step with a self made blade
Tucked under my- chat shit or get shaved
News reporters try slander my name
Shame, I still buss open my case
I thank God so I sing with grace
Lord blessed me so I stepped out the gates
Induction, man patterned the place
Smarty and Zanco on the wing first day 
You talk shit on the roads, you're a blagger
I'm locked up with my bro's had to man up
Look, me and you got passa
But you got cheffed so it don't even matter

Fresh home, fresh home, straight out the slammer 
I was on G wing
I was on HB4 where there ain't no camera 
The feds had me flat on my face
Buss case, had to climb to the top of the ladder 
I was unknown
Now I'm back on the scene as a well known rapper 
Damn right, I'm a well known rapper 
Fresh home, fresh home, straight out the slammer 
I was on G wing
I was on HB4 where there ain't no camera 
The feds had me flat on my face
Buss case, had to climb to the top of the ladder 
I was unknown
Now I'm back on the scene as a well known rapper 
Damn right, I'm a well known rapper 


Try know I supply all my G's with bulk
On road man patterned the streets, you're a joke 
You don't wanna see me turn up
'Cause I got a long ching in my coat 
No electrocution, I'm on volts
Chat shit, get rocked like a boat
Poke then cut cah the yute got soaked
Chop or tear man, I dare man, try provoke
I can Samurai step on my own 
There's no hope if the waps 'round my waist
'Cause I really do snap like Capone
Two claps and you know the booting's unknown
On a crash, only ever move loose with a phone
Banged up but now I'm ganged up on the vis' and soc' 
After late night checks
Sekkle down with a tek, bake off then lotion

--- opps see me and my boo
Let's fry up the beef cah they chat too loose
Man beat off the wap no proof
The beef goes on, now it's World War II
Re-up then feed the recruits
Bill up and add blem in my off-white boots
A yute got touched down, who's on the news? 
Top Gear in a drop-top, opps see me and my boo


Listen
No BXB when I mush Hard Rock, I put blades in brown
Let's liven the beef, paigons can't circle around
He lacked, no faces found
We two dumpy young Gs on the works up opps then twerk up the town
Rebrowse, no Vaseline ting, man dig or we rub man out
We hide from pigs cah we burst up clowns
It might back ping but I don't have doubts
They try look lit but they don't have clout
Fill that PR with a different bounce
Bought that gliz with a Turkish round
.32 or spin, let me lurk this 'round
I heard this chick want a Birkin now
Gyal love chat shit, come and twerk it down
