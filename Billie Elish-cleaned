Jimbob you motherficker did you plan the abortion yet?
Jimbob
What do you mean you didn't
We are divorcing this second
nO!
Don't give me that bullshit Blamo
I'm handing the mic to Professor Qwigley, whos a real man
Intro:
Aight
Let’s hit it here

Chorus:
Bitch I’m Changing
Cause of you
And all your sins
Say you hate me
But why you still talking
I know I was toxic
But I've been changing
Unlike you
Who still a fake
Sad girl
Just Billie Eilish
Verse:
Never did anything
At Least on purpose
The only reason you hating on me
Is cause you know
Were both perfect
You just don’t want to admit it
Saying your glad that I’m gone
But Why you still
Stalking
Haven’t thought of you
Till this very moment
But i’m also glad
I’m gone
For then I don’t have too listen
To your fake depressed ass
For another second

Chorus:
Bitch I’m Changing
Cause of you
And all your sins
Say you hate me
But why you still talking
I know I was toxic
But I've been changing
Unlike you
Who still a fake
Sad girl
Just Billie Eilish
I don’t write rhymes nigga I write checks
Write checks
Everybody know it’s just he right step
Right, left
Nigga make the wrong turn, right left
Everybody feel like Mike Tyson hit you with a left hook

Rapping on the boys got you shook like Mobb Deep
Man this the Infamous, you talking lack of emphasis
Everybody thinking that I’m Cole MacGrath
Cause I shock you niggas out your pants like I’m Lord Raiden
I’mma hunt you niggas down like my name was Kraven
I forgot the Teen Titans I don’t mention Raven
Cause she got the stone on her head that’s where her daddy at
Call me Bеast Boy, cause I turn into a whole Giraffe

Woah
Man you don’t wanna see mе
I’m rapping on these niggas can’t see me John Cena
I’m moving so fast like my name Gilbert Arenas
Cause I’mma sell this whole shit out from arenas

I don’t write rhymes nigga I write checks
Go hard, man I hope I can speak Czech
Cause I’m finna travel the world off these rhymes
Rap so good they think I might just drop
From the door to the floor and I’m blowing up like C4
Man it’s call of duty man your whole lobby gone

Everybody see me on Korean
Cause I love the dramas
And them girls got some pretty makeup
Moving so good I might change your makeup
Everybody saying Usain got to race up
Rap so good got the shoes got to lace up
Sell so much merch that the anime don’t like us

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now


Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home


Walking out of time
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space


But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear


Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home


Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'


Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer 
And I'll call you when the party's over


Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that


But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go


Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true


Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm


You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city


And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical


So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy


I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know


So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh


I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly 
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried 
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care 

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me


And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"


I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down


I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
