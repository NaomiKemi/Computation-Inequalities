Food in the ends like there ain't no drought
Flipz don't talk like he's got no mouth
I wanna make my mum so proud
Like, "Yo, Mum, book a flight, go now"
All of my ex-girls stalking me hard
Talk to my face, don't talk to my palm
Had four bills and I bought me a car
Little red whip that I bought for my marge
I straight murk, it's a walk in the park
I take care when I water my plants
These MCs wanna talk about Lord of the Mics
You ain't even lord of your yard
Dead MCs, blud, leave me alone
Me and your girl, we speak on the phone
Kill a whole crew of MCs on my own
Kill a whole crew of MCs for the throne

Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots

You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds and made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like, "What a goddess" 
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest 
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris 
Fuck the government and fuck Boris 
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
I got the sauce , don't know what you thought 
Catch me up in snowin' in my sliders and my shorts 
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk
I don't fuck with her
Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her
Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie , way too exclusive 
Chillin' in Dubai, know I get it all inclusive 
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit 
To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business
Lookin' in the mirror sayin', "Mikey, you're the illest" 
When I'm James Bond, tryna live my movie like I'm Idris
So we telling 'em look

Running through the party, bottle of Bacardi
Bro's in my ear saying "Stormz, don't do it" 
Devil on my shoulder, I don't lack 
Hit 'em with a crowbar, I don't scrap 
Even when I'm sober, I'm so gassed
Say you ride but there's no car and no mash 
Clown, stand down
Never had a MAC-10 or a trey pound
You were never bad then, you ain't bad now
Never had the MAC then, little nigga, back down
Wait, I saw bare kicks, saw bare clothes
Said fuck that, I can't wear those
I don't like them, they're not my ting
They went silent, they're all weirdos
Like yeah, Stormz gone clear
Never had a Tom Ford or a Moncler
Mandem are calm, but you see my don there?
Fuckeries, tell 'em don't do it, don't dare
Don't care who you know from my block 
You're not Al Capone, you'll get boxed 
They can take my car and my creps 
I'll still do the road in my socks
Like who's gonna stop me? You? Him?
Weed in a cigarette, blue slims
Don't be an idiot, move smart
I've been killing it, new king
Niggas ain't ready for my new stuff
You're a prick by yourself, go and group up
And when Krept went States for the BETs
I was covering Krept like a bootcut

Debate this one, hatin'-niggas gonna hate this one, ah

Rollies, got twenty-one, I been lit since twenty-one

Man are talkin' war, don't know 'bout war 'til you end in one
The machine got sweets, on a vending one
Needed a hit, could have penned him one, 'cah you're pendin' one
Aight, she wanna go to the cinema, so we just walk downstairs 
The mortgage cleared, we've overtaken all our peers 
After all these years, disrespect is all I hear
I'm Pep, I ball with flair
Off the set, they storm like, off the set, they storm like Piers
That's what I call mornin' tears
Them man are talkin' bare, but it's cool 'cause—

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day, discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day, discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


Check it
I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check
Wait two secs, let me spark this zoot
My niggas, they don't talk, they shoot
Roll up slow, then I park that coupe
And the game got fucked by the darkskin yout
Oh well, should've been watching
He was gone by the time that they clocked him
#MERKY, #SKENGMAN
What's the last one? Yeah, #PROBLEM
They should've stopped him, I don't run out of bars
Just like Chip, I don't run out of bars
Walk in the rave, put the glass to your face
Look, I make fuckboys run out of bars
Big 45 might bun out your clart
No safety, that might dun out your dance
Knock on your door like oi rudeboy, look
Forget the hype, just come out the yard
See the lightskin girls used to cuss me
Now the lightskin girls, they love me
Word to J Hus, man are ugly
But this rap ting's sick, man, trust me
Nobody can't claim that they buss me
Cuh man was out there on a fuckery
Plus we don't even talk too much
That's the reason why your girl wanna fuck me
I don't really care about your friend
Bare likkle fish, never been on the ends
Yeah, you go hard but we go harder
You shut down but nigga, we leng
You turn up but nigga, we rep
Why do man love getting me vexed?
Here for the lightskin girl with the big bumper
And the black bredrin with the breasts
Everyting blessed, what's your name?
Where you from? Roll up, grab your girl, then I'm gone
Why do they wanna know what I'm on?
Get one chance, one chance and it's gone
Man go down, put amm in a bong
This go down on the man at the front
Nigga, stay there, stop tagging along

Look, wait, look
If you got a BET, bring it out
Oh, you don't? Shut your mouth
Man just chat shit, I cut them out
Know where I come from, I'm from the south
Fuck out my house, peak when I press play
Niggas go gym but they're missing out leg day
My worst days are some of your best days

Look at the size of my fist, I will spark you
