Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel


One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin'—


Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 


She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things 
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah 


My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 


Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms


My smile is beamin' , my skin is gleamin' 
The way it shine, I know you've seen it 
I bought a crib just for  the closet 
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah


I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it 
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman


I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

 And I can be all the things you told me not to be
 When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
 And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me


You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman



I tell you all the things you should know
So baby, take my hands, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah
But you're different from the rest
And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

I've been here all night 
I've been here all day 
And boy,  got me walkin' side to side 


I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' 
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' 

These friends keep talkin' way too much

Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...


I've been here all night

And boy,  got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night

And boy, got me walkin' side to side 


Been tryna hide it
Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me 
And boy, I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me


These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I…

Pickin' it up , pickin' it up 
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up 
Yeah, we turnin' it up

Hmm


You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right" 
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight 

I don't wanna keep you up 
But show me, can you keep it up? 
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee 
And I've been eatin' healthy 
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah 
Savin' up my energy

Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five

Ain't used to feelin' this way

But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face 
Now I wanna know how you taste 
Usually don't give it away 
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it


Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

Break up with your girlfriend

You could hit it in the mornin' 
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time


Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm


Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face


Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history


Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday 
Never need no , no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be


Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you

Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true 
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I’m runnin' with you 


Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday 
Never need no , no onе else, babe
'Causе I'll be


Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

But for you, I kinda, kinda want to 
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too 
Yeah, I'm down too
Switchin' the positions for you
This some shit that I  usually don't do 
But for you, I kinda, kinda want to 
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too 

Mmm
Hey, yeah



Ah


I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime


So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby


There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever
There's nobody on these streets
If you told me that the world's endin'
Ain't no other way that I can spend it


Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans 
I could stay here forever
