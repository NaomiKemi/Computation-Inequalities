BAN DRILL,BAN FREEDOM
2023/MAR

Road rap and UK drill music originated in south London. The current prohibition may spark debate over free speech and artistic expression that promotes violence.

They also issued artists with criminal behaviour orders and banned them from making more music without getting permission from the police.

My Pratical project and academic essay addresses the emotional impact drill music may have of the english youth of today...

Audience: My project invities all people especially those interested in drill, that work for NLP and Sentiment analysis systems 

Contributions: To explore the sentiment of drill lyrics and explore if the lyrics promotes negativity, to further understand the what emotions drill present, I wil be  comparison of famous pop artists that youth consume today and artists that actively on the charts in the UK. I will be using language processing systems coded in python to analysis both genres.

Documentation and practices: 
apply three sentiment analysis AI system
collect lyrics using genuis API

Limitations and Future work:
The data is quite limited, maybe I should expand to asking listeners how drill effects them
